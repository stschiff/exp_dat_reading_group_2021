# Session 4

This session contains two lessons of a hands-on tutorial about the effects of missing data on PCA.

The `prepare_data.R` script downloads and prepares some genotype data. Intermediate data is stored in `poseidon_data` (content in .gitignore), but the eventually relevant data products are already here in the repository (`context_info_one.csv`, `geno_matrix_one.txt`, `context_info_three.csv`, `geno_matrix_three.txt`). It is therefore not necessary to run this script.

The lessons are prepared as `.Rmd` (Rmarkdown) documents and additionally in already rendered `.html` versions. They depend on some wrapper- and convenience functions in `helper_functions.R`.

To explore the lessons, you can download the .html files and view them in a browser. If you want to engage with the code interactively, then we suggest you clone the repository and open the `session_4.Rproj` RStudio project file with RStudio.

An additional and separate data exploration experiment prepared by Sandra Oliveira can be found in `lesson_3_pca_for_masked_data.pdf`.
